SENDER: Ms.Aminata B.Kabila <ami_kabila@yahoo.com>
RECEIVER: R@S
DATE: 
SUBJECT: I NEED YOUR URGENT REPLY
BODY

Good day
 
I know this mail might come to you as surprise but kindly allow me the 
opportunity of introducing myself. I am Ms. Aminata Bobi Kabila; 
daughter of  the former head of state/president of Congo-Kinshasa 
(former 
Zaire), Mr. Laurent Desire Kabila. 
I got your particulars through the South African Chamber of Commerce; 
However, i am contacting you in order to ask for your assistance on 
this 
confidential business proposal with full financial benefit for both my 
family and you.
 
Before i go into further details, please be informed that i am writing 
without any other perso(s) pre-knowledge of my contacting you on this 
transaction. Therefore i will appreciate same attitude to be maintained 
all through. I have the sum of USD8.5 Million from a secret sale of 
Diamond by my father before he was assassinated by one of his body 
guards 
(Rashid) on January 16th 2001. The essence of this mail is to ask you 
to stand as my foreign partner and receive the fund on my behalf as i 
can not do much on my own due to security reasons, my narration below 
will explain better. Before i continue, be well informed that your 
share 
in this transaction has been calculated at 30% of the total sum, 5% for 
expenses that may be incurred if any and the rest for my family and me.
 
My father as an African traditionalist was a polygamist thereby having 
married so many wives, and my mother being the second wife of my 
father, my step-brother Joseph, who is the current president of my 
country, 
is the son of the first wife and he does not have any knowledge about 
this deal.
 
Already president Joseph is using his power to colonise all the money 
and private property which our father left behind for the whole family. 
Now my mother, myself and my younger brother are left with nothing in 
the inheritance of my late father�s wealth. Our situation is seriously 
critical that we need your assistance to help us receive this fund for 
relocation overseas and for proper investment jointly between we and 
you. Let me quickly assure you the 100% safe proof of this transaction 
because the diamond sales are packaged from the onset in a pattern that 
shows no direct trace or linkage with us (Kabila family). At present 
the 
money is in cash and is secured in a security company as family 
treasures.
I am waiting for your quick and favourable response, and in case you 
have any question(s), do not hesitate to contact me urgently.
 
Thanks,
 
Ms. Aminata B. Kabila.

 For Immediate Release Friday, October 12, 2001 Media Contact: Michael Mack Vice President of Business Development Phone: (202) 207-0540 michael.mack@votenet.com Votenet Brings NAFSA's National Elections Online Firm formally launches eBallot software and consulting practice for associations and member-based organizations October 26, 2001, Washington, D.C. Votenet Solutions, Inc. is pleased to announce its latest web-based software innovation, eBallot, which allows organization's members to vote online. This easy-to-use, cost effective method of voting will change forever how private elections are conducted. NAFSA (Association for International Educators <URL> employed Votenet's technology as the sole voting mechanism during their recent 2002 national officer's election. With 35 candidates running in twenty races internationally, NAFSA members were able to vote online for the first time in NAFSA's history. "As an international association with a dispersed membership, the benefits of Votenet's application are incalculable," says Denise Wold, Director of Membership Services, NAFSA, an organization of 6400 members. "The key to our success was the ease-of-use of the voting system. Our members found the voting application to be intuitive and convenient. Taking our election online allowed our members to view candidate profiles and vote in just a few minutes." Votenet's eBallot software provides: Convenient 24 hour a day online ballots integrated into the organization's website; Candidate biographies; Election management suite that enables election administrators to monitor voting and view real-time voting reports; Login security ensures one vote per eligible voter; Web-based application is scalable to handle any size election or referendum. Ideal for any organization with elected officials, Votenet's eBallot Software is not only secure, but it is easy-to-use and will aid in cutting mailing, labor, and other overhead costs involved with elections. "Votenet's online election system saved time and money and will certainly benefit us in future election years," remarked Bill Newman, Chief Financial Officer at NAFSA. "Any association or organization interested in slashing the financial and man-power costs associated with an election should consider working with Votenet to conduct a virtual election." "A large number of elections take place every year at national and international associations, businesses, charities, and unions. Now to be able to perform that function, while also offering candidate biographies, a 'voting wizard' to aid voters, and real-time results, online is impressive. The time, trouble and cost associated with a traditional paper intensive election system makes Votenet's eBallot Software a very high ROI application for any organization with a large or geographically dispersed voting constituency," says Glen Hughlette, CEO and President of Votenet Solutions. The eBallot software is immediately available from Votenet Solutions.

softnet technology ( otcbb : sttc ) > softnet technology corp . ( otcbb : sttc ) what could be a more bullish sign for a public company than its ceo buying back a ton of shares ? very little , and the fact that the ceo / president of softnet has purchased over 1 million shares of sttc in the open market speaks volumes about his commitment and belief in the company ' s prospects . that in turn generally instills confidence in employees , business partners , analysts , shareholders and we expect , our readers . but what  s his motivation ? here  s what we know . in real estate , it ' s always been  location , location , location !  in the 1990 s technology boom , it was  platform , platform , platform !  after the internet stock bubble burst and the market sorted out the strong from the weak , things settled down and a new term gained prominence in technology circles :  search engine .  as yahoo grew and ebay became interactive , tech visionaries could see that  engine , engine , engine !  was the market ' s newest money making mantra . in this millennium , the growth of google and ask jeeves has proven that a good search engine can be a terrific money maker for its owners . softnet technology , has its own proprietary commerce search engine that operates the innovative wholesalebyus .

SUBJECT: FROM  MR . RAHA. ALI , WAITING TO READ FROM YOU SOONEST
BODY
FROM THE DESK OF:MR . RAHA. ALI
dIRECTOR AUDIT AND ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT,
BANK OF AFRICA, OUAGA-BURKINA-FASO.

ATTN: Please.

Greetings to you, I am Mr.Raha.Ali. the Account Manager of Late Mr.Morris 
Thompson in Bank of Africa, here in Burkina Faso.However I got your contact 
through the International web directory.I decided to contact you by email 
because I feel that it is more secured and private.

Recently i discovered a Dormant Account with a huge amount of Money Valued 
USD14,000,000.00 (Fourteen Million Dollars only)that belongs to one of our 
late Customer who died in a plane crash.

During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came 
across a very huge sum of money belonging to Late Mr. Morris Thompson an 
American great industrialist and a resident of Alaska, who unfortunately 
lost his life in the plane  crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which
crashed on January 31 2000,including his wife and only daughter.

You shall read more news about the crash on visiting this site which I
got during my 
investigation;http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/
andttp://www.nativefederation.org/history/people/mThompson.html

The fund has been dormant in his account With this Bank without any claim of 
the funds in our custody either from his family or relation before our 
discovery of this development.

The Banking law here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed for Six 
years, it will be forfeited to the Bank treasury as an unclaimed bill.It is 
only a foreigner that can stand as a next of kin and It is upon this 
discovery that I decided to contact you to collaborate with you to pull
out this dormant fund.

In order to avert this negative development, I on behalf of my trusted 
colleagues now seek your permission to have you stand in as next of kin to 
Our late Customer so that the fund will be released and paid into your 
account as the beneficiarys next of kin now that the bank is still
expecting a next of kin or relative of the deceased ,Late Mr. Morris 
Thompson.

In fact we could have done this deal alone but because of our position in 
this country as civil servants, we are not allowed to operate a foreign 
account and that would eventually raise an eye brow on our side during the 
time of transfer since I still work in this bank, this is the actual
reason why I required a second party or fellow who will assist me forward 
claims as the next of kin and also provide either an existing bank account 
or to set up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this fund, even an empty 
a/c can also serve for this purpose.

On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 40% as 
gratification for your assisting me, and the remaining 60% will be for me.

What I want from you is for you to act as the deceased next of kin. I have 
in my possession, all the necessary informations to successfully accomplish 
this operation. Bear in mind that this proposal is 100% risk free.

Further Information will be given to you as soon as I receive your positive 
response. I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your
interest to enable us proceed.
I await your Urgent Response

Regrads,
MR .RAHA. ALI
BANK OF AFRICA (BOA)

BODY
FROM THE DESK OF: 
Zhang He, 
Bank of China.. 
Shenzhen
China.
 
Dear Kathleen Crain, 
I am Zhang He, Bank Manager of the Bank of China, Shenzhen branch, China. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. 
On June 7, 2000, a consultant/ contractor with the Chinese Solid Minerals Corporation, made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at Twenty One Million Dollars (US$21,000,000.00) only in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to the forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the South Korea Solid Minerals Corporation that he died along with his wife from a plane crash. On further investigation, I found out that he died Without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. 
I therefore made further investigation and discovered that he did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. 
This sum of US$21,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. 
According to Laws of China, at the expiration of eight (8) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South Korea Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. 
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to assist me in receiving this money as I have every machinery set to enable you receiver this money via a Finance firm based overseas. 
I need your urgent assistance so that this money will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will require you to send me your complete names, contact address and telephone and fax numbers so that I will be able to apply for the necessary documents to enable you receive the money via the Finance firm overseas in your name. After receiving the money, we will share in the ratio of 75% for me and 25% for you. Note that the project will be 100% risk free. Considering my position as the credit officer of the bank, I guarantee the successful execution of this transaction. I have the facilities to obtain relevant documents to enable me lift the money from the bank overseas. 
If you are interested, please reply immediately. Upon your response, I will then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. 
I will also let you have the contact details of the Finance Firm and the country it is located in Overseas. Please send me your confidential TELEPHONE and FAX Numbers for fast communication, as I will need to speak to you to personally. You should observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us. Awaiting your urgent reply. 
 
Thanks and regards. 
 
Zhang He.

we know you needed this , so . . . . greetings , this email is about fighting spam , and winning . > > please forward to your friends , family and co-workers to people that want to get spam out of their email : read this , you ' ll like what i am doing . . . . : ) to people that want to flame me for whatever reason : do n't be an egomaniac , i have a right to free speech , and the right to say it to a lot of people , so buzz off . - - - - - first let me tell you who i am and what i do . my name is robert young , i live in moscow , idaho , u . s . a . , and i have been using the internet since 1990 . i have watched the internet go from a small community of serious professionals to a roaring civilization of over 100 million people . until 8 months ago i had been a private investigator specializing in the apprehension of criminal fugitives . after 8 years of doing that i started getting burned out and decided to turn my life long hobby of programming computers into a full time job . now i write specialized applications for investigating and locating information on the internet . this summer , during the last week of july , i finally got fed up with the fact that i could not seem to get my 5 year old email address off of spam lists . i would reply to their emails with the word " remove " like most of them say and the next day i would get more . i sent my email address to remove lists , complained to administrators , postmasters , and my friends . none of it seemed to make a bit of difference . i decided to investigate the bulk email business . what i found made me so angry i almost blew a fuse . did you know : 1 . spammers steal valid email addresses and use them for return addresses . you could get the blame ! 2 . spammers purposely deceive filters designed to protect your email address . 3 . spammers " hijack " mail servers that are meant to relay messages from computer to computer . when they overload these servers , your legitimate email can be lost ! 4 . congress is not going to pass any laws in the united states anytime in the near future to stop this garbage , and they may never do so . some members of congress have actually campaigned through email . ( does that - really - surprise you ? ) 5 . when spammers register domain names with internic they never pay their bills because they know that the domain will be blocked and useless within 30 days , and interring gives them that long to pay before cutting them off . 6 . some spammers buy lists of accounts from hackers that have broken into internet service providers and use these accounts , that belong to other people , so they can connect to the internet without being concerned about losing the account . again , you get the blame , you lose your account . most of these spammers are genuine , authentic , certified jerks . i decided to get even , i took all of this very personally . within 3 weeks , the spam had dropped to a trickle . now i only get 2 or 3 a week instead of 7 or 8 each day . update : as of 02-oct - 1998 i have not gotten a single spam for 5 days . that 's a fact . i am starting to get comments from people that joined me two weeks ago that have noticed drops in their spam count of as much as 70 % . that is a fact as well . my list of active spammers is over 80 individuals now and it is growing every day . it does n't take government intervention , we all know that our government could n't feed a cat without spending $ 400 on a bag of cat food and starting 8 committees . what it does take is someone with the guts to take action , now ! what did i do ? first i recognized that spammers are not going to just quit , they make too much money doing it . the self righteous " anti-spammers " only wipeout mostly innocent business people with poor judgment . they have not put a single spam mailer out of business yet . not a one ! they just pop up with a different domain name , and dialup account the next day . the anti spammers have actually wiped out several potentially successful remove lists . you know why ? they do n't want it to end because then they would n't have a crusade anymore . think i ' m kidding ? i know who the anti-spammers are as well and believe me , their motivations are purely egotistical . in my opinion they have made spam worse by driving it underground and ruining the web based remove lists . try to go to www . remove-list . com , it is n't there anymore . so i am doing it different . human nature matters . . . i used my investigative experience to hunt down the - actual people - that were sending me spam . names , phone numbers , addresses , etc . it was n't easy but i had the background and knowledge to do it . i called each of these people and told them that if they did not immediately cease and desist sending mail to my address that i was going to give their name , address , phone number and anything else i had on them to every service provider in the country . that i would publish their information on the internet via the web , and that i would give their information to every ( legitimate ) anti - spam group i could find . i was polite and adult about the issue but i made it very clear that i was dead serious . nothing else has worked . people have been trying to get rid of spam for several years with no success . this method works ! ! ! if i told you i could do the same thing for you would you be interested ? i thought so . here is what you need to do : first : start your text editor ( notepad , vi , whatever ) second : type the following information and print it . first name last name primary email address ( remember your email may have two forms such as : joe @ isp . com and joe @ mail . isp . com . include both , contact your isp if you are n't sure ) family member ' s addresses ( one per line please ! ) third : mail this information to me : robert young attn : no more spam please ! ! ! c / o super fast services 116 e . 3rd . st . suite 206 moscow , id 83843 we need donations to support this fight . i started out doing this for friends and family , then their friends and family , and now it is starting to cost us a lot of money . please include a donation of five dollars either a five dollar bill , or a check made out to me . we are hoping that there are enough decent people out there that appreciate what we are doing and will pitch in a few bucks to help us pay for the phone calls , computer time , database searches , and hiring people to do the data entry for the 600 plus letters we are getting every day . p l e a s e h e l p ! i guarantee you will think it is the best five bucks you have ever spent if you are sick of spam . thanks for taking the time to reply to this letter , i hope to hear from you soon . working together we can defeat unwanted spam for good .

Getting Business

Anyone thinking about going
into business for themselves, or wanting to expand an existing business
should rush for the world's largest "one-stop-money-shop" where FREE business
grants to start or expand a business is being held for you by the Federal
Government.
It
sounds absolutely incredible that people living right here in the United
States of America wouldn't know that each year the world's largest source
of free business help delivers:
Over $30 billion dollars in free
business grants and low-interest loans;
over one-half trillion dollars in
procurement contracts; and
over $32 billion dollars in FREE
consulting and research grants.
With an economy that remains
unpredictable, and a need for even greater economic development on all
fronts, the federal government is more willing than it ever has been before
to give you the money you need to own your own business and become your
own boss!
In
spite of the perception that people should not look to the government for
help, the great government give-away programs have remained so incredibly
huge that if each of the approximately 8 million businesses applied for
an equal share, they would each receive over $70,000.
Most
people never apply for FREE Business Grants because they somehow feel it
isn't for them, feel there's too much red-tape, or simply don't know who
to contact.The fact is, however, that people from all walks of life do
